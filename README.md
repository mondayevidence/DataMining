# DataMining
This project segments customers in groups based on what they eat using cluster analysis
on a given transaction data. The dataset provided consists of a market basket dataset as
well as a dataset containing recipes and their corresponding ingredients. Two mining algorithms
were used here; cosine similarity algorithm module from the scikit-learn library as well as the
apriori algorithm to cluster customers into various groups upon careful experimentation and analysis.
A well documented report on this process is found in the 'docs' folder
